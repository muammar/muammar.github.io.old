### About me

If you arrived here I think you should know that my name is Muammar. Talking
about me I think is not something interesting enough. I might write that I was
born on December, 28th. I like the winter, the grey. I have a master in
Chemistry and I'm doing a PhD in Quantum Chemistry in France. I am used to
reading and programming in my free time. I enjoy playing the guitar, in fact
I had a band called [Taciturna](http://myspace.com/taciturnaband). I write
poetry, some people say it is bad other ones say that it has something good in
its inside. Here you are a piece of something that I've written:

_"Dreams are like the wind... you follow them and it seems as if you wouldn't be
able to reach them... you realize that it's possible to reach them, when you
feel tired and then the breeze rubs your face... you catched the wind..."_

I don't like dancing, and I do hate Reggaeton. I hate cigarettes. I hate the
lies, and when I feel stressed by something as well. I like Mafalda. I don't
like politicians, they say lots of lies, and they don't care about us.

I hate Windows (XP, VISTA or whichever). I think that everything should follow
a natural dot. I do enjoy traveling because I can meet new people, and see
different places. I like traveling because in each travel I do, I rediscover
myself. I like taking pictures. I am passionated about the Quantum Mechanics
and Debian. I love my wife even knowing that I don't have the certainty that
she feels the same. I think that the pain is part of our lives.

If you are still reading at this point so I could say that talking about me
it's interesting :), but I do prefer to think that you reach to read at this
point because you didn't have anything else to do :), I stop writing here,
Ideas are not coming to my mind anymore.

### About this site

This site contains parts of my life. Generally, topics showed here are referred
to free software, chemistry, poetry, life, and those stuff that make feel
happy.Most of the content written here are my personal opinions. I always have
had the need of expressing what I think and this space has been the place to do
it.

I guess that your first impression about these pages is that they are full of
text and there is no images at all. I could assume that you like reading
because you have reached to this point. The reason of having more text than
images is because I love minimalism and on the other hand, having more text
than images gives the possibility for those who have to pay what they consume
in their Internet connections of not wasting money in images about me, but in
text (aka information) instead.

I will present you the links which I consider the most important:
