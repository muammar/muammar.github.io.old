      Responsibilities include:
      * Report to the lead for Predictive Sciences of the IPS organization;
      scenarios involve a range of datasets and learning objectives, including
      drug discovery, multi-modal modeling, uncertainty quantification,
      and predictive models for chemical and biological datasets.
      * Formulation and implementation of predictive modeling and machine learning
      solutions for optimizing chemical structures, drug-target interactions, and
      physicochemical properties.
      * Application of cutting-edge machine learning (deep learning) approaches to
      physicochemical property predictions and molecular interaction challenges.
      * Work alongside experts in similar applications of machine learning in the
      biotechnology domain, including:
        1. Collaboration to develop human-in-the-loop systems to capture and
        operationalize machine learning datasets and algorithms used by BMS
        scientists.
        2. Application of supervised and semi-supervised deep learning methods
        to derive robust, generalizable, and reusable representations for chemical
        and biological assay data.
        3. Design of multi-task, multi-modal, and generative neural network
        learning approaches to tackle real-world drug discovery optimization
        problems.
      * Pursue leading research in applied scientific machine learning that
      demonstrates the value of predictive methods to accelerate and optimize
      drug development.
      * Derive and apply predictive approaches in collaboration with BMS
      colleagues in the Informatics Predictive Sciences and Chemistry
      departments.
      * Apply rigorous internal standards for applied machine learning practice,
      including evaluation of methods, approaches, and solutions.
      * Present strategies, techniques, results, and conclusions to BMS
      colleagues and external audiences.
      * Enable strategic collaborations with academic and commercial
       collaborators to benefit therapeutic programs. I am the BMS
       representative before the “Machine Learning for Pharmaceutical Discovery
       and Synthesis Consortium” collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute
       of Technology. For more information, see https://mlpds.mit.edu/.
      * Implement and apply uncertainty quantification of epistemic uncertainty
       of predictive models to steer scientific discovery.
      * Supervise and mentor interns to develop their careers and benefit
      therapeutic programs at BMS.

  - title: Postdoctoral Scholar
    company: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory

        Responsibilities include:
        
        * Developed a Python library to ease the deployment of machine learning models for chemistry and
          materials sciences. https://github.com/muammar/ml4chem. This package is helping us advance our
          research faster because we can consistently implement new methods.
        * Developed a neural network model that can learn how to predict retention times from chromatography
          data. These models can be used by experimentalists to get insights about the substances they study
          without explicitly running the experiments.
        * Applied autoencoders to extract features and systematically studied their topology to understand their
          effect on the predictive power of models used for material sciences.
        * Generated data sets using web-scraping and diversified their variance with active learning techniques.
        * Worked on a project for Scaling Interactive Science for Data-Intensive Discovery for the Linac Coherent
          Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.
        * Led and designed research projects executed by summer interns.
        * Wrote scientific publications to show our results to the community.

        Responsibilities include:
        
        * Worked on the acceleration of electronic structure calculations using machine learning models 
          to decrease orders of magnitude of the computational time needed by the simulations.
        * Was actively involved in the development of the Atomistic Machine-learning Package (Amp) created
          and maintained by the Catalyst Design Laboratory at Brown University 
          https://bitbucket.org/andrewpeterson/amp.
        * Implemented kernel ridge regression within an atom-centered mode in their machine-learning package.
        * Participated in the design of scientific projects and supervision of students during their research
            in our laboratory.
        * Presented scientific results in international conferences.
