### Interests

I am interested in the theory of the electronic structure of atoms and
molecules. In the framework of my PhD thesis, I am working in the
metal-insulator transitions in low dimensional systems as well as other
theoretical studies. I have also put online some posters and slides about the
work I have done during my PhD [here](http://muammar.me/files/chemistry/).

Part of my work has consisted in method development. We are proposing a new
indicator called *[Position Spread tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Position_Spread)* that can be used to characterize
chemical bonds and at the same time monitor the wave functions (Î¨).

I have developed expertise in the use of methods based on the wave function
such as: [Multi-configurational self-consistent
field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-configurational_self-consistent_field)
(CASSCF), [N-electron valence state
perturbation theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-electron_valence_state_perturbation_theory)
(NEVPT), [Multireference configuration
interaction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multireference_configuration_interaction)
(MRCI), and [Full configuration
interaction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_configuration_interaction).


### List of published software

I have some github repositories with some programs that may be of interest:

- **Huckel** ([https://github.com/muammar/huckel](https://github.com/muammar/huckel))

 This is a python program that takes your MOLPRO output file, and from the
 Cartesian coordinates, it forms a Huckel hamiltonian matrix to then give you
 the eigenvalues to be plotted against the normalized eigenvalues ordinal
 numbers as showed in Ref.[1], and [5]. It is also possible to delete desired
 Carbon atoms by indicanting their respective numbers in the structure.

- **Centerfinder** ([https://github.com/muammar/centerfinder](https://github.com/muammar/centerfinder))

  This python script intends to look for localized molecular orbitals (LMO)
near to atoms based on the center of charges and prepare a MOLPRO input
file in order to perform later incremental calculations as stated in H.
Stoll, Chem. Phys. Lett., 1992, 19. This is normally a very tedious work to
be done by hand, and it's there when centerfinder comes to help.

- **Vertex** ([https://github.com/muammar/vertex](https://github.com/muammar/vertex))

  This is a very simple program that helps you to fit a parabola from three
points. This can be useful to determine the minima of a potential energy
surface.
