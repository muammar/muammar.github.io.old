I play the classical guitar since I was 13 years old. I studied different
styles including: venezuelan waltz, tango, flamenco, baroque music, etc. In the
recent years I have been rather inactive, however I started again.

In the section shown below I will present the Music Repertory I am preparing
right now. I will be adding more and more guitar songs, and if possible some
recordings.

### Music Repertory

- Romance - Anonimo.
- Variazioni, op. 45 (guitar) c. 1811 - Mauro Giuliani.

More information soon.
