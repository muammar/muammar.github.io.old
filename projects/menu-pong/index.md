# Menu Pong

Take a break from work and play a game of classic Pong — in the menu bar. Like dancing without actually dancing.

***Hopefully soon in a Mac App Store near your menu bar***

### Features

- Play against the computer

- Play against a friend on the same keyboard (player 2 uses W and S keys to move her paddle)

- Doesn't slow down your computer (tech speak: Uses very few resources)

It's pretty awesome.
