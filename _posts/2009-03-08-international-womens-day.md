Today is the International Woman&#8217;s Day ([IWD][1]) so I will take advantage of my blog to congratulate all women either into the [Debian Project][2] and in General.  
The women&#8217;s history, from my point of view, has been involved of many difficult situations. Women have had to face the inequality in many ways and levels. On the other hand, it has changed a lot but there still happening some cases nowadays.  
I got surprised, when I read the article in Wikipedia, by some [controversial][3] facts. Sometimes it is a shame our &#8220;human&#8221; behavior&#8230;
