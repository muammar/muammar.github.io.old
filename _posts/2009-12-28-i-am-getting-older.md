Well, today I am getting older. I am 26 now. I am singing this song for me:  
They Might Be Giants &#8212; Older  
You&#8217;re older than you&#8217;ve ever been.  
And now you&#8217;re even older.  
And now you&#8217;re even older.  
And now you&#8217;re even older.  
You&#8217;re older than you&#8217;ve ever been.  
And now you&#8217;re even older.  
And now you&#8217;re older still.  
TIME! Is marching on.  
And time.. is still marching on.  
This day will soon be at an end and now it&#8217;s even sooner.  
And now it&#8217;s even sooner.  
And now it&#8217;s even sooner.  
This day will soon be at an end and now it&#8217;s even sooner.  
And now it&#8217;s even sooner.  
And now it&#8217;s sooner still.  
You&#8217;re older than you&#8217;ve ever been.  
And now you&#8217;re even older.  
And now you&#8217;re even older.  
And now you&#8217;re even older.  
You&#8217;re older than you&#8217;ve ever been.  
And now you&#8217;re even older.  
And now you&#8217;re older still.
