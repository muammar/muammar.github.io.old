It starts out like a season in reverse  
A way to set your mind above and over words  
(Like) attached means (your) identity  
Erases things so how can we record?  
Distress call code-word is I wanna live  
He makes it up as it goes and it goes away  
To places he can only hide in other peoples minds  
He makes it up as it goes  
Your rational mind&#8217;s insane Taste the sound you make  
When the light from the sun (Or the story that never gets sold) Is your mother  
With an effortless smile you pervade to be  
Always in-between aisles (They said you must stare to see) An optimistic Daring me  
would you trade your soul for gold?
