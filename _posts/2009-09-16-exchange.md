Well, I was so tired of my mini hp 2133 that I decided to exchange it or selling it. The main reason of this is the lack of Linux support from VIA (No 3d acceleration, no free driver for Wifi, etc). I was looking at [http://www.mercadolibre.com.ve/ ][1]and I found a guy who was selling/exchanging a G1. When I saw that, I thought: this could be the chance to get a G1 without using the credit card :P. So I contact this guy, I met him at [La Vereda del Lago de Maracaibo][2] and after checking both devices we made the exchange.  
I have to say that I am happy with the exchange because I was using a [Motorola w180][3] which is a fuckin&#8217; shame of phone. Besides, the G1 is in very good shape.  
The G1 is a very amused phone. I had to reset it. Such a process was very easy. I followed the procedure at <http://www.androidcentral.com/factory-reset-tmobile-g1/>  
It&#8217;s time to go to bed now, or I hope so ;-). I think I have done a good exchange, don&#8217;t you think so?
