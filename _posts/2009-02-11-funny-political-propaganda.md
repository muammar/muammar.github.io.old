On February 15th, we are having an election to decide whether a constitutional amendment will be accepted or not in Venezuela. I don&#8217;t want to talk about this. Instead, I&#8217;d like to talk about the funniest Political Propaganda I have seen at the moment regarding the elections.  
I was driving from my girlfriend&#8217;s home to mine when suddenly I saw a guy with a banner hanged on him. When he was near to my car, I was able to read what he had written on the banner. I read:  
*&#8220;Vota NO a la mierda. Dale bomba&#8221;.*  
Look at the picture:

<img class="serendipity_image_left" width="480" height="280" style="float: center; border: 0px; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px;" src="/blog/uploads/Image047.jpg" alt="" />  
Translated it means:  
*&#8220;Vote NO to the shit. Flush the toilet&#8221;.*  
I got very surprised about the imagination used by that guy. I laughed out loud. I think it has been the funniest political propaganda that I have seen ever.. ðŸ˜›
