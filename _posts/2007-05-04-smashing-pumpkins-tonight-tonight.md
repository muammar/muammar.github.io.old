Time is never time at all  
You can never ever leave without leaving a piece of youth  
And our lives are forever changed  
We will never be the same  
The more you change the less you feel  
Believe, believe in me, believe  
That life can change, that you&#8217;re not stuck in vain  
We&#8217;re not the same, we&#8217;re different tonight  
Tonight, so bright  
Tonight  
And you know you&#8217;re never sure  
But your sure you could be right  
If you held yourself up to the light  
And the embers never fade in your city by the lake  
The place where you were born  
Believe, believe in me, believe  
In the resolute urgency of now  
And if you believe there&#8217;s not a chance tonight  
Tonight, so bright  
Tonight  
We&#8217;ll crucify the insincere tonight  
We&#8217;ll make things right, we&#8217;ll feel it all tonight  
We&#8217;ll find a way to offer up the night tonight  
The indescribable moments of your life tonight  
The impossible is possible tonight  
Believe in me as I believe in you, tonight
