Hello  
I&#8217;ve waited here for you  
Everlong  
Tonight  
I throw myself into  
And out of the red, out of her head she sang  
Come down  
And waste away with me  
Down with me  
Slow how  
You wanted it to be  
I&#8217;m over my head, out of her head she sang  
Chorus-  
And I wonder  
When I sing along with you  
If everything could ever feel this real forever  
If anything could ever be this good again  
The only thing I&#8217;ll ever ask of you  
You&#8217;ve got to promise not to stop when I say when  
She sang  
Verse 2-  
Breathe out  
So I could breathe you in  
Hold you in  
And now  
I know you&#8217;ve always been  
Out of your head, out of my head I sang  
Chorus-  
And I wonder  
When I sing along with you  
If everything could ever feel this real forever  
If anything could ever be this good again  
The only thing I&#8217;ll ever ask of you  
You&#8217;ve got to promise not to stop when I say when  
She sang  
Chorus-  
And I wonder  
If everything could ever feel this real forever  
If anything could ever be this good again  
The only thing I&#8217;ll ever ask of you  
You&#8217;ve got to promise not to stop when I say when  
She sang
