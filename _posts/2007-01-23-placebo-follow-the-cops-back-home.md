Linda canción, espero que la disfruten. ¡Yo adoro esa canción..!  
  
The call to arms was never true,  
Time to imbibe, here&#8217;s to you,  
I&#8217;ll tell you stories bruised and blue,  
Drum machines and landslides.  
Just one more round before we&#8217;re through,  
More psychedelic yuppie flu,  
It&#8217;s such a silly thing to do,  
Now we&#8217;re stuck on rewind..  
Let&#8217;s follow the cops back home,  
Follow the cops back home,  
Let&#8217;s follow the cops back home,  
And rob their houses.  
The call to arms was never true,  
Let&#8217;s take a ride and push it through,  
Suspended animation in blue,  
Blame it on apartheid,  
Let&#8217;s spend the night in Jimmy Choo&#8217;s,  
I&#8217;ll give you coats and cheap shampoo,  
I&#8217;ll give you nothing else to do,  
Now we&#8217;re stuck on rewind..  
Let&#8217;s follow the cops back home,  
Follow the cops back home,  
Let&#8217;s follow the cops back home,  
And Rob their houses..  
Let&#8217;s follow the cops back home  
Follow the cops back home  
Let&#8217;s follow the cops back home  
And rob their houses..  
The call to arms was never true,  
I&#8217;m medicated..how are you?  
Let&#8217;s take a dive swim right through,  
Sophisticated point of view.  
Let&#8217;s follow the cops back home  
Follow the cops back home  
Let&#8217;s follow the cops back home  
And Rob their houses..  
Let&#8217;s follow the cops back home  
Follow the cops back home  
Let&#8217;s follow the cops back home  
And rob their houses..
