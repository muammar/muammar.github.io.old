El video de abajo está bién sádico <img src="http://muammar.me/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> y la canción es bastante buena. Tanto me ha gustado que decidí dedicarle una entrada a el video y a la letra de la canción. Espero que lo disfruten. xD  
  
You&#8217;re older than you&#8217;ve ever been.  
And now you&#8217;re even older.  
And now you&#8217;re even older.  
And now you&#8217;re even older.  
You&#8217;re older than you&#8217;ve ever been.  
And now you&#8217;re even older.  
And now you&#8217;re older still.  
TIME! Is marching on.  
And time.. is still marching on.  
This day will soon be at an end and now it&#8217;s even sooner.  
And now it&#8217;s even sooner.  
And now it&#8217;s even sooner.  
This day will soon be at an end and now it&#8217;s even sooner.  
And now it&#8217;s even sooner.  
And now it&#8217;s sooner still.  
You&#8217;re older than you&#8217;ve ever been.  
And now you&#8217;re even older.  
And now you&#8217;re even older.  
And now you&#8217;re even older.  
You&#8217;re older than you&#8217;ve ever been.  
And now you&#8217;re even older.  
And now you&#8217;re older still.
