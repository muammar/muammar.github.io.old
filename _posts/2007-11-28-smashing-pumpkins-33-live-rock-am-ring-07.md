Speak to me in a language I can hear  
Humour me before I have to go  
Deep in thought I forgive everyone  
As the cluttered streets greet me once again  
I know I can&#8217;t be late, supper&#8217;s waiting on the table  
Tomorrow&#8217;s just an excuse away  
So I pull my collar up and face the cold, on my own  
The earth laughs beneath my heavy feet  
At the blasphemy in my old jangly walk  
Steeple guide me to my heart and home  
The sun is out and up and down again  
I know I&#8217;ll make it, love can last forever  
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth  
And you can make it last, forever you  
You can make it last, forever you  
And for a moment I lose myself  
Wrapped up in the pleasures of the world  
I&#8217;ve journeyed here and there and back again  
But in the same old haunts I still find my friends  
Mysteries not ready to reveal  
Sympathies I&#8217;m ready to return  
I&#8217;ll make the effort, love can last forever  
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth  
Tomorrow&#8217;s just an excuse  
And you can make it last, forever you  
You can make it last, forever you
