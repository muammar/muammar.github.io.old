Since I bought the mini HP, I have an additional disc-space of 160 GB. So, I took as a custom syncing my old and dear laptop with this new one using rsync. For some stupid reason, but I start thinking that this is something related to the Murphy&#8217;s Law, I didn&#8217;t make a sync these last 2 days. I made a mistake with LVM when resizing my /home partition in the old laptop (which I was using during these 2 days) and now I am crossing my fingers to be able to recover the filesystem.  
So, if you are reading this I&#8217;ll advise you something. For the sake of god, If you can maintain backups constantly, do not ever hesitate to have them as updated as possible, so that you won&#8217;t feel like a dumbass just like I feel right now. For being a lazy, I am now having lots of work to do in order to repair my file system. If I had made a backup I wouldn&#8217;t have been feeling so worried about this. The worst of all, it is that I am working in other stuff like writing my thesis, so I cannot concentrate&#8230;  
Remember, making backups is something very good. (That phrase was for me)
