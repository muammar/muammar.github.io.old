I just stumble into this:  
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyOtb136n6g>  
My first impression was: WTF???!!!! I was used to listening to [Cornell][1] in Sound Garden, Audioslave or in his Album [Euphoria Morning][2], but this is the shittest change that I have seen ever. I was told to visit his [web page][3], a request made from [Gerardo Curiel][4], maybe with the hope that that had been a joke, but When I went there&#8230; it was real&#8230; Chris Cornell had become in a kind of Justin Timberlake :S  
What should I expect now? Deftones doing something like this?:
