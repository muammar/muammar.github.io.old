I recently decided to buy a chromecast audio (CCA) to plug in my Harman Kardon
Soundsticks III. My main motivation was to avoid using the 3.5mm jack to plug
the phone or the computer when I wanted to switch devices. Bluetooth
connectivity was not an option given their poor quality of sound and short
range of the signal to connect (limited to 10m). There are many different
options in the market being Sonos the most widely spoken and known right now
because of its Hi-Fi Wifi solution. But Sonos is also known as very expensive
tech. For instance, the starting price of a connected speaker is around $200.
Another limitation going beyond price is the fact that you can only stream
using Sonos' application (as far as I investigated) something I don't find
appealing. As I already had my speakers, I was looking for something to cast
over them using wifi. Sonos proposes *Connect* which is like what chromecast
audio does but for a price which is 10 times expensive!.


I am not rich (not yet, LOL), so after listening to some Sonos speakers in
a shop without getting surprised, I decided to buy the chromecast audio at 39â‚¬.

Installation
============


Cast from Mac OS X
==================

What about Linux
================
I have dual boot, and my linux distro is debian unstable. To cast all audio to
the CCA there is a very interesting solution in github using pulse audio
called [pulseaudio-dlna](https://github.com/masmu/pulseaudio-dlna).
