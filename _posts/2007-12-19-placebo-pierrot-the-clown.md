Me gusta mucho Placebo. Y esta canción de verdad que se merece compartirla, esta versión acústica está muy buena.  
  
Leave me dreaming on the bed  
See you right back here tomorrow for the next round  
Keep this scene inside your head  
As the bruises turn to yellow  
The swelling goes down  
And if you&#8217;re ever around  
In the city or the suburbs of this town  
Be sure to come around  
I&#8217;ll be wallowing in sorrow  
Wearing a frown  
Like Pierrot the Clown  
Saw you crashing round the bay  
Never seen you act so shallow  
Or look so brown  
Remember all the things you&#8217;d say  
How your promises rang hollow  
As you threw me to the ground  
And if you&#8217;re ever around  
In the backstreets or the alleys of this town  
Be sure to come around  
I&#8217;ll be wallowing in pity  
And wearing a frown  
Like Pierrot the Clown  
When I dream I dream of your lips  
When I dream I dream of your kiss  
When I dream I dream of your fists  
Your fists&#8230; Your fists  
Leave me bleeding on the bed  
See you right back here tomorrow for the next round  
Keep this scene inside your head  
As the bruises turn to yellow  
The swelling goes down  
And if you&#8217;re ever around  
In the city or the suburbs of this town  
Be sure to come around  
I&#8217;ll be wallowing in sorrow  
And wearing a frown  
Like Pierrot the Clown  
Like Pierrot the Clown  
Like Pierrot the Clown  
Like Pierrot the Clown
