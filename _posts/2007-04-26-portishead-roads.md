Esta canción me rebota todo el día en la cabeza. Espero que la disfruten.  
  
Ohh, can&#8217;t anybody see  
We&#8217;ve got a war to fight  
Never found our way  
Regardless of what they say  
How can it feel, this wrong  
From this moment  
How can it feel, this wrong  
Storm.. in the morning light  
I feel  
No more can I say  
Frozen to myself  
I got nobody on my side  
And surely that ain&#8217;t right  
And surely that ain&#8217;t right  
Ohh, can&#8217;t anybody see  
We&#8217;ve got a war to fight  
Never found our way  
Regardless of what they say  
How can it feel, this wrong  
From this moment  
How can it feel, this wrong  
[INSTRUMENTAL]  
How can it feel, this wrong  
This moment  
How can it feel, this wrong  
Ohh, can&#8217;t anybody see  
We&#8217;ve got a war to fight  
Never found our way  
Regardless of what they say  
How can it feel, this wrong  
From this moment  
How can it feel, this wrong
