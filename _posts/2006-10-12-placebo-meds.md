I was alone, Falling free,  
Trying my best not to forget  
What happened to us,  
What happened to me,  
What happened as I let it slip.  
I was confused by the powers that be,  
Forgetting names and faces.  
Passersby were looking at me  
As if they could erase it  
Baby did you forget to take your meds?  
Baby did you forget to take your meds?  
I was alone,  
Staring over the ledge,  
Trying my best not to forget  
All manner of joy  
All manner of glee  
And our one heroic pledge  
How it mattered to us,  
How it mattered to me,  
And the consequences  
I was confused,  
By the birds and the bees  
Forgetting if I meant it  
Baby did you forget to take your meds?  
Baby did you forget to take your meds?  
Baby did you forget to take your meds?  
Baby did you forget to take your meds?  
And the Sex and the drugs and the complications  
And the Sex and the drugs and the complications  
And the Sex and the drugs and the complications  
And the Sex and the drugs and the complications  
Baby did you forget to take your meds?  
Baby did you forget to take your meds?  
Baby did you forget to take your meds?  
Baby did you forget to take your meds?  
Baby did you forget to take your meds?  
Baby did you forget to take your meds?  
I was alone,  
Falling free,  
Trying my best not to forget.
