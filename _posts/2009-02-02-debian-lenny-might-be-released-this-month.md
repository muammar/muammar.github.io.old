I&#8217;d like to join those who also feel the happiness of knowing that a new Debian release is getting closer <img src="http://muammar.me/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> It has been a long wait, but the result will be a good one.  
I am anxious to see the official announce and to have a bunch of new versions of packages in unstable, so that my system will be more funny than it is ðŸ˜€
