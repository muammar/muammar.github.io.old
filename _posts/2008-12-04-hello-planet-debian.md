Well, this is my first post so I have to say, hello planet! I&#8217;ll introduce myself. My name is Muammar, I am 24 and I am studying chemistry. I am doing my thesis on quantum optics. I am from Venezuela. I hope I won&#8217;t bother you with my posts, anyways, they won&#8217;t be so many at all&#8230;
