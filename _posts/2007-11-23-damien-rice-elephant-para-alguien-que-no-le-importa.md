Well this has got to die  
I said, this has got to stop  
This has got to lie down  
With someone else on top  
Well, you can keep me pinned  
It&#8217;s easier to tease  
But you can&#8217;t paint an elephant  
Quite as good as she  
And she may cry like a baby  
And she may drive me Crazy  
&#8216;Cause I am lately lonely  
So why&#8217;d you have to lie?  
I take it I&#8217;m your crutch  
The pillow in your pillow case  
Is easier to touch  
And when you think you&#8217;ve sinned  
Do you fall upon your knees?  
Or d&#8217;you sit within your picture?  
Do you still forget the breeze?  
And she may rise, if I sing you down  
And she may wisely cling to the ground  
Cause I am lately, horny  
So why would she take me horny?  
What&#8217;s the point of this song? Or even singing?  
You&#8217;ve already gone, why am I clinging?  
Well I could throw it out, and I could live without  
And I could do it all for you  
I could be strong  
Tell me if you want me to lie  
&#8216;Cause this has got to die  
I said, this has got to stop  
This has got to lie down, down  
With someone else on top  
You can both keep me pinned  
&#8216;Cause it&#8217;s easier to tease  
But you can&#8217;t make me happy  
Quite as good as me  
Well you know that&#8217;s a lie
