Today, I am turning 25. Now what?! It&#8217;s a quarter of a century!. Now, I have friends who I have met for more than 15 years&#8230; How fast the time pass by&#8230; Now, I am not the one making fun of those who were 25 years old&#8230; (If I remember it well, I used to do it when I was 20).  
It&#8217;s time to redefine some stuff in my life. I confess this age has had an impact on me. My next goals, in a short time, are :  
1) Finish my NM process.  
2) Write my thesis.  
3) Make a publication of a paper about DNA in a Journal of Chemistry.  
There is a phrase of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John\_Randolph\_of_Roanoke" target=blank">John Randolph</a> which I&#8217;d like to share: **Time is at once the most valuable and the most perishable of all our possessions.**
