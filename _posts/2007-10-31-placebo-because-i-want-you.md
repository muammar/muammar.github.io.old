Fall into you  
Is all I seem to do  
When I hit the bottle  
Cause I&#8217;m afraid to be alone  
Tear us in two  
Is all it seems to do  
As the anger fades  
This house is no longer a home  
Don&#8217;t give up on the dream  
Don&#8217;t give up on the wanting  
And everything that&#8217;s true  
Don&#8217;t give up on the dream  
Don&#8217;t give up on the wanting  
Because I want you too  
Because I want you too  
Because I want you too  
Because I want you  
Because I want you  
Stumble into you  
Is all I ever do  
My memory&#8217;s hazy  
And I&#8217;m afraid to be alone  
Tear us in two  
Is all it&#8217;s gonna do  
As the headache fades  
This house is no longer a home  
Don&#8217;t give up on the dream  
Don&#8217;t give up on the wanting  
And everything that&#8217;s true  
Don&#8217;t give up on the dream  
Don&#8217;t give up on the wanting  
Because I want you too  
Because I want you too  
Because I want you too  
Because I want you  
Because I want you  
Because I want you too  
Because I want you too  
Because I want you  
Because I want you  
Fall into you  
Is all I ever do  
When I hit the bottle  
Cause I&#8217;m afraid to be alone  
Tear us in two  
Tear us in two  
Tear us in two  
Because I want you too  
Because I want you too  
Because I want you  
Because I want you  
Because I want you too  
Because I want you too  
Because I want you  
Because I want you
