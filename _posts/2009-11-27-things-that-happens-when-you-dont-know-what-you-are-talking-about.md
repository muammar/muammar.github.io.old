In Debian, if there exists a [bug][1] in a version of a package in SID (let&#8217;s take as an example GRUB2 version 1.97+20091125-1), and it has a severity marked as Critical, then it won&#8217;t touch testing until such a bug is fixed&#8230; It is as simple as that.  
What happen when?:  
a) You are not sure which [Debian release][2] you are using.  
b) You are not sure how Debian handles bugs reported with severity: critical.
