Can you explain to me how you&#8217;re able, how  
It’s too late for me now  
there’s a hole in the earth I’m out  
there’s a hole in the earth I’m out  
Can you explain to me now  
if you’re stable, whilst  
I think you know the truth  
there’s a hole in the earth, I’m out  
I hate all of my friends  
they all attack sometimes  
there’s a hole in the earth, I’m out  
there’s a hole in the earth, lets take a bow  
this is the end  
somewhere  
this is the end  
somewhere  
there’s a hole in the earth  
there’s a hole in the earth  
I hate all of my friends (I’m out)  
there’s a hole in the earth  
I’m away somewhere
