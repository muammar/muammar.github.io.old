Estuve hoy buscando algunos videos de Smashing Pumpkins en [youtube][1] Y encontré esta presentación en los MTV en 1994. Esta versión de Disarm está muy buena. Espero que la disfruten.  
  
Disarm you with a smile  
And cut you like you want me to  
Cut that little child  
Inside of me and such a part of you  
Ooh, the years burn  
I used to be a little boy  
So old in my shoes  
And what i choose is my choice  
What&#8217;s a boy supposed to do?  
The killer in me is the killer in you  
My love  
I send this smile over to you  
Disarm you with a smile  
And leave you like they left me here  
To wither in denial  
The bitterness of one who&#8217;s left alone  
Ooh, the years burn  
Ooh, the years burn, burn, burn  
I used to be a little boy  
So old in my shoes  
And what I choose is my voice  
What&#8217;s a boy supposed to do?  
The killer in me is the killer in you  
My love  
I send this smile over to you  
The killer in me is the killer in you  
Send this smile over to you  
The killer in me is the killer in you  
Send this smile over to you  
The killer in me is the killer in you  
Send this smile over to you
